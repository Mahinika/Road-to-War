# Road of War: Hero Mechanics Guide

This guide outlines the core mechanics of the improved Hero System.

## Specialized Resource Systems

Each hero class uses a specific resource type that governs how they use abilities.

| Resource | Classes | Mechanics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mana** | Paladin, Mage, Priest, Shaman, Warlock, Druid | Starts full. Regenerates steadily. Used for most spells. |
| **Energy** | Rogue, Druid (Cat) | Starts at 100. Regenerates very quickly (20/sec). Used for fast-paced combat. |
| **Rage** | Warrior, Druid (Bear) | Starts at 0. Gained by taking or dealing damage. Decays at 2/sec out of combat. |
| **Focus** | Hunter | Starts at 100. Regenerates steadily (5/sec). Used for physical ranged abilities. |

## Tactical Formations

The party can switch between different formations to adapt to combat situations.

*   **Line (Standard)**: Standard horizontal arrangement. Good for general travel and balanced combat.
*   **Wedge (Arrowhead)**: Tank at the front, others flanking behind. Ideal for aggressive pushes.
*   **Shield Wall (Tight)**: Heroes cluster closely. High defensive benefit, but vulnerable to area-of-effect (AoE).
*   **Spread Out (Loose)**: Heroes maintain maximum distance. Best for avoiding AoE damage and kiting.

## Combat AI & Interrupts

Heroes now possess advanced tactical awareness:
*   **Interrupt Logic**: Heroes will prioritize using "Interrupt" type abilities (like Kick or Shield Bash) when they detect an enemy is casting a spell.
*   **Role-Based Targeting**:
    *   **Tanks**: Prioritize high-threat targets and enemies attacking healers.
    *   **Healers**: Focus on the lowest health party member, with a bias towards the tank.
    *   **DPS**: Target enemies that are low on health or priority targets like enemy healers (Disruptor strategy).

## Specialization Passives

Specializations now grant unique passive bonuses that scale with the hero's development:
*   **Protection (Paladin/Warrior)**: Increased Threat Multiplier (1.5x-1.6x), Bonus Defense, and expanded Health.
*   **Assassination (Rogue)**: Massive Critical Chance and Poison damage bonuses.
*   **Holy (Paladin/Priest)**: Significant Healing Output and Mana Regeneration bonuses.
*   **Fury (Warrior)**: Increased Attack Speed and Critical Chance.

## Movement-Based Traits (Planned)

*   **Evasive**: Gain 10% Dodge while moving.
*   **Sniper**: Deal 15% more damage when stationary for more than 3 seconds.
*   **Momentum**: Physical damage increases based on distance traveled in the last 2 seconds.
