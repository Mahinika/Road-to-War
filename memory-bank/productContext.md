# Product Context: Incremental Prestige RPG

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to create an engaging idle/incremental RPG that provides continuous progression without requiring active gameplay. The automatic nature allows players to make strategic decisions about equipment and progression while the game runs itself.

## Problems It Solves
- **Player Time Constraints**: Accommodates players who can't actively play but still want progression
- **Complexity Barrier**: Simple mechanics that don't overwhelm casual players
- **Engagement Loop**: Provides satisfying incremental progress and clear advancement goals

## How It Should Work

### Core Gameplay Loop (5-Man Team System)
1. **Party Creation**: Player selects 5 classes (1 tank, 1 healer, 3 DPS) at game start
2. **Automatic Movement**: Party moves from left to right automatically along "Road to War" (100-mile progression)
3. **Procedural World**: World segments generate as party progresses, difficulty scales with mile
4. **Automatic Combat**: Party fights enemies using role-based AI (tank holds aggro, healer heals, DPS damage)
5. **Loot Collection**: Defeated enemies drop equipment and items
6. **Equipment Management**: Player equips better items per hero to improve stats (WoW TBC/WotLK stat system)
7. **Talent System**: Player allocates talent points per hero (earned per level after level 10)
8. **Encounter System**: Random shops, quests, and treasures appear
9. **Hero Swapping**: Player can swap heroes (new hero starts at Level 1, can revisit earlier miles to level)
10. **Prestige Reset**: Eventually reset for meta-progression benefits

### User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Engagement**: Player sees action from the start
- **Clear Progression**: Stats and improvements are visible and understandable
- **Strategic Depth**: Simple mechanics with meaningful equipment choices
- **Satisfying Loops**: Regular rewards and clear advancement milestones
- **Low Friction**: Minimal UI interaction required for basic progression

### Player Journey
1. **New Player**: Watches automatic combat, finds first equipment
2. **Learning Player**: Understands stats and equipment synergies
3. **Strategic Player**: Optimizes equipment for specific challenges
4. **Advanced Player**: Manages prestige decisions and meta-progression

### Monetization Considerations (Future)
