/**
 * Hero Texture Regeneration Script
 * ⚠️ OBSOLETE: This script was for Phaser 3. 
 * 
 * In Godot, hero regeneration is handled automatically by HeroSprite.gd
 * when equipment changes via the equipment_changed signal.
 * 
 * No manual regeneration needed - equipment changes trigger automatic visual updates.
